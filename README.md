# d2l_notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks created for personal study of the book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai).  
The notebooks are based on the official d2l-ai implementation but have been modified for personal use and may not match the examples in the book exactly.

## üìö About

*Dive into Deep Learning* is an interactive deep learning book that teaches deep learning concepts through code, math, and discussions.  
The official version is available at [d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the environment and run the notebooks locally:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   uv venv --seed
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

## üß™ Usage

Once Jupyter Notebook is running, navigate through the directories to find the notebooks.  
You can open and execute them interactively.
